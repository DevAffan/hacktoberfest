++ Poem for my Country - Pakistan: ++
It's my home, it's my land,

It's water and it's sand,

Is my life, is my pride,

There's clearly nothing to hide.

From high ranges of mountains,

to naturally occuring fountains.

Gardens with butterflies,

beneath the summer skies.

With 5 generous rivers, 

and a deep sea that might give you shivers.

Lush green plains,

with alot of heavy rains.

It is a broken piece of paradise,

fallen from high above,

paked with Allah's tender and love.

'Terrorists' is what the world named us,

murderers is how iit framed us.

Its not true,

Pakistan is a terrorist, how did you knew?

You've never been there, 

not breathed in its lovely air!

Try to understand,

it's a paradise, not a simple land!
